Paper flashcards for studying kanji. There are pre-generated sets for grades 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and JLPT levels N5, N4, N2, and N1 in the subdirectories `grade/` and `jlpt/`.  If those don't meet your needs, you can generate your own files.

# Generating your own flashcards

The script `cardmaker.rb` produces kanji flashcards, according to either grade level or JLPT level.  Each card has the kanji, grade level, and stroke count on the front, and the back shows the English meaning, onyomi, kunyomi, and some common words containing that kanji.

Running the script produces an `fodg` file which can be opened and in [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).  After minor modifications are complete, print the flashcards out on thick double-sided A4 paper, cut them out, and you can study.
